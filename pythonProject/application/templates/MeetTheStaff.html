                  <p class="card-text">Before joining the graduate scheme at Sky I studied Politics and Spanish at the University of Bristol so not exactly a direct path towards cybersecurity. As part of my Politics degree I decided to focus my dissertation on Cyberwarfare in the Russia-Ukraine War and its implications for the future which led me to applying to cybersecurity graduate schemes across the board. Sky looked pretty epic and hear I am!</p>
                  <p class="card-text">I began the graduate scheme in the Security Consultancy team which was split into 3 sub-sections: Training & Awareness; Analysts; and Consultancy. From here I went on to join the Threat Intelligence team for my second rotation. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">The biggest lesson I have learnt from my time at Sky so far is probably the importance of going around and meeting people and learning about what all of the different teams do. This is first of all for the reason of building relationships with people from across the business but also so that you can understand why your team does what they do and how this links to the bigger picture.</p>
