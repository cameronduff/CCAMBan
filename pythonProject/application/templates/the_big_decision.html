                <h5>1. Exploring Available Roles</h5>
                <p>The first step in the process is receiving a spreadsheet from your manager that lists all the potential roles available to you. To get a head start, take a look at last year’s spreadsheet to get an idea of what might be available this time around. However, keep in mind that there’s no guarantee the same roles will be offered this year.</p>

                <h5>2. Narrowing Down Your Options</h5>
                <p>When you receive the current spreadsheet, you’ll be able to use filters to narrow down the roles based on office location, role type, and area within Sky. Some roles are fully remote, while others require you to be based in a specific office. We recommend narrowing your choices down to 3-5 roles that truly interest you.</p>

            <h5>Reaching Out</h5>
            <p>We know it can be daunting to approach potential managers for your first rotation, so we’ve put together some tips and tricks to help you get started.</p>
            <p>You can reach out to managers using Teams—everyone is super friendly, so don’t be shy! If you’re interested in a rotation, here’s how you can initiate the conversation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Start with a Short Intro Message:</strong> Introduce yourself briefly, mention the rotation you’re interested in and why.</li>
              <li><strong>Include Your LinkedIn Profile:</strong> For brevity, you might want to include a link to your LinkedIn profile, so they can learn more about your experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Request a Short Call:</strong> Ask if they would be available for a brief call to discuss the role further. This shows your interest and initiative.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember, reaching out is a great opportunity to learn more about the role and make a positive first impression. Good luck!</p>

            <h5>Preparing for the Call</h5>
            <p>Managers might approach the call differently, so it’s important to be prepared for various scenarios. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your conversation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Be Ready to Answer Questions:</strong> Some managers may ask you more about your interest in the role, so it’s helpful to have prepared some answers in advance. Think about why you’re excited about the role and how it aligns with your career goals.</li>
              <li><strong>Learn About the Role:</strong> Other managers might prefer to present to you about the nature of the role and what it involves. Listen carefully and be ready to ask insightful questions that show your interest and understanding.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on Cultural Fit:</strong> Some managers may simply want to have a chat to see if you’re a good cultural fit for their team. This is your chance to emphasize your enthusiasm for the role and demonstrate how your personality and values align with the team’s culture.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Regardless of the approach, always emphasize your enthusiasm for the role. Be honest about your experience—managers know you’re a grad in your first rotation, so they’ll understand if you lack certain technical skills or are nervous about things like public speaking. The key is to make a positive overall impression.</p>
