    <section>
        <h5>1. Exploring Available Roles</h5>
        <p>The first step in the process is receiving a spreadsheet from your manager that lists all the potential roles available to you. To get a head start, take a look at last year’s spreadsheet to get an idea of what might be available this time around. However, keep in mind that there’s no guarantee the same roles will be offered this year.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h5>2. Filtering and Narrowing Down Your Options</h5>
        <p>When you receive the current spreadsheet, you’ll be able to use filters to narrow down the roles based on office location, role type, and area within Sky. Some roles are fully remote, while others require you to be based in a specific office. We recommend narrowing your choices down to 3-5 roles that truly interest you.</p>

        <h5>3. Reaching Out to Managers</h5>
        <p>Once you’ve identified your top choices, it’s time to connect with the managers of those roles. Reach out to see if they’re available for a chat to discuss the role in more detail. This is your chance to learn more about the responsibilities, the team, and how the role aligns with your career goals. In the next section, we’ve provided some tips on how to make the most of these conversations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h5>4. Submitting Your Preferences</h5>
        <p>After gathering all the information you need, you’ll be asked to submit a form with your top three role choices. You’ll need to include the role ID and write a short paragraph explaining why you’re interested in each role. Your manager will review your submissions and take them into account when making the final decision on your placement.</p>

        <h5>5. The Outcome</h5>
        <p>Don’t worry—most graduates are successfully placed in their first-choice role. The process is designed to match you with a position where you can thrive and contribute meaningfully to the team.</p>
